## Setup

### Using Git

Git is a version-control system used to coordinate and share work among multiple team members It comes pre-installed on Mac and Linux systems, but you will most likely need to download and install it if you are using it on Windows for the first time. You can download it from Git's official website [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win). The download should start automatically. Feel free to just select all the default install options during setup.

Once you have git installed, run the command below in your terminal (Mac/Linux) or command prompt (Windows) to clone this repo: 

`git clone https://github.com/colezuber/b2b_immersion.git`

You'll most likely want to create separate branches for each member of the team to work on to make merging your work easier. You can find out how to do this and other useful git features [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)

### Setting up Jupyter and Python

We suggest installing Anaconda to run python, Jupyter, and several useful python libraries commonly used in Data Science. You can download Anaconda for your OS [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (downloading the Python 3.7 version is recommended).

Once you have Anaconda installed you'll want to start your jupyter server. To do this on Mac/Linux run the command below

`jupyter notebook`

For Windows, the easiest way to start your jupyter server is by launching the Jupyer Notebook Desktop app. This will automatically launch the UI in a separate browser window.

You can navgiate to the repo you cloned by enter the url in your browser that is displayed in the output (most likely http://localhost:8888/) From there, you can create a Python 3 notebook where you can store all your work.
