# b2b_immersion

## Setup

### Using Git

Git is a version-control system used to coordinate and share work among multiple team members. Run the command below in your terminal to clone this repo: 

`git clone https://github.com/colezuber/b2b_immersion.git`

You'll most likely want to create separate branches for each member of the team to work on to make merging your work easier. You can find out how to do this and other useful git features [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)

### Setting up Jupyter and Python

We suggest installing Anaconda to run python, Jupyter, and several useful python libraries commonly used in Data Science. You can download Anaconda for your OS [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (downloading the Python 3.7 version is recommended).

Once you have Anaconda installed, run the command below to start your jupyter server

`jupyter notebook`

You can navgiate to the repo you cloned by enter the url in your browser that is displayed in the output (most likely http://localhost:8888/) From there, you can create a Python 3 notebook where you can store all your work.
